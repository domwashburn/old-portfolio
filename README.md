# old-portfolio
a repo to hold my old portfolios code so while I'm updating it

### Don't judge me based on this :sweat_smile: :sweat_smile: :sweat_smile:
I haven't updated this in ~a while~ too long... 

I've learned a lot since I built this a few years ago, but haven't made time to create a new portfolio.

I promise there's a new one coming soon!!
